				<p class="lead">Hello lovely people, thank you for checking out my blog! My name is Elizabeth Joy (nice to meet you). I'm a twenty-something living in Madison, Wisconsin still trying to figure out what I'm doing with my life. I call it a quarter-life crisis, but we will get through this together, right? Anywho, here is a few tid-bits about me:</p>
					<ul id="aboutList" class="text-center">
						<li>I take few things seriously</li>
						<li>I love, love (seriously, I do)</li>
						<li>I'm a HUGE fan of comedy</li>
						<li>I'm pretty hard to offend, yep, come at me trolls!</li>
						<li>I F*#@KING love my cat Henry, oh and my fiance, Seth...I guess :)</li>
						<li>I can't wait to get you know you all of you out there, and again thanks for stopping by <a href="#">Consistently Inconsistent</a>!</li>
					</ul>
				<p>xoxo</p>
